This is really quick hackjob that scraps the Philadelphia Parx poker table logs and builds a database. Then shows the data in a nice timeline graph.

This was mostly out of my curiosity, I'm not afflicated with that poker room, I've never even been there. If you want to build something of this idea/code, please go ahead. I unfortunately don't have time to work on this anymore.
